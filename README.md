# TODO
- GO TO next test failure. Hard to know if anything failed.
- View the test run progress in a dedicated window. Sometimes it takes a while.
- Enable for class based tests
- Abstract most functions/consts to make them configurable via init.lua
- Make the buffer a floating window
- clear all markers command
- Make it reuse the buffer from the last test run if it exists
- Copy the command that would have been used instead of running it

- DONE make the buffer not grab focus
    - Not longer shows by default, only when requested with `ts`

- DONE Run entire file. Will be hard to mark the right functions probably.
